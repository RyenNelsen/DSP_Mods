A collection of mods I have written for [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/).

You will need to create a `Libraries` folder with the following files:
- 0Harmony.dll
- Assembly-CSharp.dll
- BepInEx.dll
- BepInEx.Harmony.dll
- UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
- UnityEngine.dll
- UnityEngine.UI.dll
