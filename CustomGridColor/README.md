# Custom Grid Color
Customize the grid colors while building, destructing, and laying foundation.

## Installation
Check the [DSP Wiki](https://dsp-wiki.com/Modding:Getting_Started) on how to install mods.

## How to use
Run the game with the mod installed to generate the configuration file (io.ryen.customcolorgrid.cfg).

The configuration file can be found within `DPS_GAME_DIRECTORY\BepInEx\config` or under the "Config editor" in r2modman.

There are currently three grids within the game, building, destructing, and laying foundations. You can customize these three individually by setting the custom RGBA values in the configuration file.

Valid values for the RGB portion is any number between 0 and 255. (e.g. 117) Valid values for the alpha channel are any float (decimal number) between 0 and 1. (e.g. 0.221)
